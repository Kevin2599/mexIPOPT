### mexIPOPT
**by Enrico Bertolazzi**

This is my rewrite of Peter Carbonetto MATLAB interface for IPOPT
a software package for large-scale â€‹nonlinear optimization.

Source code and documentation for IPOPT can be downloaded from:

https://projects.coin-or.org/Ipopt

On OSX IPOPT can be installed using Homebrew (http://brew.sh).

**Why do a job already done?**

The original MATLAB interface (https://projects.coin-or.org/Ipopt/wiki/MatlabInterface) seems not maintained for OSX and do not work with recent
MATLAB distributions.
I have reorganized and simplified the original interface 
(only internally) and eliminated the bug in the interfacing
of sparse pattern between MATLAB and IPOPT.
Moreover I tried to improve error catching.

**How to compile**

The interface is written in C++. To compile the mex file run the script
`compile.m` in the `lib` directory or, for UNIX-like OS, use the 
`Makefile` in the same directory.

For the uage of the library use `addpath` to add `lib` directory
in the search path or move the contents of `lib` to a directory 
in the search path.

**Examples**

In the directory `example` original example of Peter Carbonetto
shows the usage of the interface.
